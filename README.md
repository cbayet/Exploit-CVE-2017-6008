# Exploit-CVE-2017-6008

The CVE-2017-6008 is a vulnerability in the HitmanPro scan that allows privilege escalation by exploiting a kernel pool buffer overflow.
The exploits here use the Quota Process Pointer Overwrite attack as described in the [Tarjei Mandt's paper](http://www.mista.nu/research/MANDT-kernelpool-PAPER.pdf)

Also, the exploits use my [Pool sprayer library](https://github.com/cbayet/PoolSprayer)

# Windows 10 version

This version use another vulnerability in the hitmanpro37.sys driver, an Out-Of-Bounds read, which we use to leak the Pool Cookie.
This leak allows us to use the very same attack on Windows 10.
